# ITestPens

## What's this silliness about?
Sometimes I pentest stuff, and I've been trying to sharpen my skills by banging through the [AttackDefense](https://attackdefense.com) labs by [PentesterAcademy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/).  This site will be a written regurgitation of what I learn in those excellent labs.  

*Warning: this site contains spoilers - don't read this content unless you're ok with that!*

## Who do you think you are?
I'm [Brian](https://brianjohnson.tv).  I run [7 Minute Security](https://7minsec.com) where I do assessments, pentesting and training, and I also do the weekly [7MS podcast](https://7ms.us).  

## I think I'm ok with everything I just read.
Great.
